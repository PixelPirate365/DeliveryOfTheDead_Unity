Delivery of the Dead: My First Unity Game Project

"Delivery of the Dead" is my first foray into game development using Unity, designed as a 2D fast-paced delivery game. The player takes on the role of a driver navigating a monster-infested world, tasked with making 12 quick deliveries to these creatures. Despite being a basic game, it offers an entertaining, adrenaline-fueled gameplay experience.

Features: Fast-Paced 2D Gameplay: Race against the clock to deliver packages to monsters in a 2D world. Immersive Sound and Visual Effects: Enhanced gaming experience with engaging sound physics and effects. Dynamic User Interface: Interactive menu screen and game scene designed for easy navigation and aesthetic appeal. Learning Experience: This being my first Unity project, it demonstrates the foundational principles of game design and Unity's functionalities. Screenshots:

Installation: This game follows a standard Unity project installation process.

This project marks the starting point of my journey into game development. As I continue to learn about the Unity engine and game design, I plan not only to refine and enhance "Delivery of the Dead", but also to explore RPG-style game creation in future projects.
